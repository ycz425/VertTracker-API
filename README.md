# VertTracker API
The VertTracker API is a RESTful API designed to be a convenient tool to help athletes, coaches, and fitness enthusiasts track and analyze vertical jump performance. This API allows users to log their vertical jump measurements, view progress summaries, and gain insights into their performance over time. The VertTracker API computes users' vertical jumps based on their hang times â€“ how long they remain off the ground during their jumps. By simply recording a video of themselves jumping, users can easily measure their vertical jump performance with minimal setup.

ðŸš§ **Development in Progress** ðŸš§

This API is currently in the development stage. All features are either under construction or subject to change.
Please note that the API may not be fully functional and is subject to changes as development progresses.
